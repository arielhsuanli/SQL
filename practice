/* Write an SQL query to print details of the Workers who are also Managers.*/

/*Solve with Inner Join*/
SELECT * FROM `Worker` W
INNER JOIN `Title` T
ON W.worker_id = T.worker_ref_id
AND T.worker_title in ('Manager');

/*My own anser: solve with subquery*/
SELECT * FROM `Worker`
WHERE `Worker_ID` IN (
SELECT `Worker_ref_id` FROM `Title`
WHERE `Worker_title` = 'Manager')
;
